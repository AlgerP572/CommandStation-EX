  // The sensor list is a linked list where each sensor's 'nextSensor' field points to the next.
  //   The pointer is null in the last on the list.
  //   To partition the sensor into those sensors which require polling through cyclic calls
  //   to 'IODevice::read(vpin)', and those which support callback on change, 'firstSensor' 
  //   points to the start of the overall list, and 'lastSensor' points to the end of the list
  //   (the last sensor object). This structure allows sensors to be added to the start or the
  //   end of the list easily.  So if an input pin supports change notification, it is placed at the 
  //   end of the list.  If not, it is placed at the beginning.  And the pointer 'firstScanSensor' 
  //   is set to the first of the sensor objects that requires scanning.  Thus, we can iterate
  //   through the whole list, or just through the part that requires scanning.
