 *  Class PWM for servos and variable brightness LEDs.  Well, anything
 *  that can be driven by a Pulse Width Modulated signal, really...
 *  In fact, all the class does is converts the values of '1' and 
 *  '0' on the input pin into the values corresponding to 'activePosition' 
 *  and 'inactivePosition' respectively on the output pin, with a 
 *  configurable progression between states.  The device 
 *  attached to the output pin decides whether it's PWM or whatever!
