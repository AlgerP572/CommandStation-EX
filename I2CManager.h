/* 
 * Manager for I2C communications.  For portability, it allows use 
 * of the Wire class, but also has a native implementation for AVR
 * which supports non-blocking queued I/O requests.
 * 
 * Helps to avoid calling Wire.begin() multiple times (which is not)
 * entirely benign as it reinitialises).
 * 
 * Also helps to avoid the Wire clock from being set, by another device
 * driver, to a speed which is higher than a device supports.
 * 
 * Thirdly, it provides a convenient way to check whether there is a 
 * device on a particular I2C address.
 * 
 * Non-blocking requests are issued by creating an I2C Request Block
 * (I2CRB) which is then added to the I2C manager's queue.  The 
 * application refers to this block to check for completion of the
 * operation, and for reading completion status.
 * 
 * Examples:
 *  I2CRB rb;
 *  uint8_t status = I2CManager.write(address, buffer, sizeof(buffer), &rb);
 *  ...
 *  if (!rb.isBusy()) {
 *    status = rb.status;
 *    // Repeat write
 *    I2CManager.queueRequest(&rb);
 *    ...
 *    status = rb.wait(); // Wait for completion and read status
 *  }
 *  ...
 *  I2CRB rb2;
 *  outbuffer[0] = 12;  // Register number in I2C device to be read
 *  rb2.setRequestParams(address, inBuffer, 1, outBuffer, 1);
 *  status = I2CManager.queueRequest(&rb2);
 *  if (status == I2C_STATUS_OK) { 
 *    status = rb2.wait();
 *    if (status == I2C_STATUS_OK) {
 *      registerValue = inBuffer[0];
 *    }
 *  }
 *  ...
 *  
 * Synchronous (blocking) calls are also possible, e.g. 
 *  status = I2CManager.write(address, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
 * 
 * When using non-blocking requests, neither the I2CRB nor the input or output
 * buffers should be modified until the I2CRB is complete (not busy).
 * 
 * Timeout monitoring is possible, but requires that the following call is made
 * reasonably frequently in the program's loop() function:
 *  I2CManager.loop();
 *
